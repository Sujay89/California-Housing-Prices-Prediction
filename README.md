# California-Housing-Prices-Prediction
This project is buildt with the help of SciPy, NumPy, Seaborn and Matplotlib. In oder to visulize our data and gain various insights, various types of scattered plots are drawn using Matplotlib. Also, for each variable affecting the cost of houses, various histograms are drawn to get a better understanding of the dataset. Then, I have evaluated my model based on three algorithms. The Linear Regression model gave an efficiency of 65.19% whereas the random forest algorithm gave an efficiency of 82.75%. Better efficiency of 83.07% was given by GridSearchCV algorithm for this same dataset.
